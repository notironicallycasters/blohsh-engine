# Blohsh Engine or Battle Verticy ? 🤷‍♂
3D engine I made with Python/Pygame to learn Computer Graphics and 3D rendering.

## Features ?
- Render 3D(No way 😱😱😱)
- Render faces with colors !!!
- Rotation along point
- Camera with:
  - Perspective projection
  - Position
  - Rotation
- Freecam movement
- Homemade depth buffer:
  - Sorts faces from nearest to closest so the far ones renders first
- Culling:
  - Culls faces off screen
  - Culls faces behind camera(Kind of stupid since the screen culling is already enough(I think 😭😭🙏🙏))
- OBJ format importation:
  - Vertices ✅
  - Triangular faces ✅
  - Quad faces ❌
  - Materials ❌
  - UVs ❌
  - Normals ❌
